<DT><B>Description</B>
<DD>
Stars is an X11 client that simulates stars rushing past or receding
from a viewport. The interactive controls allow the user to control 
the size and shape of the stars as well as the direction of their movement,
even causing them to wander about the screen.
<DT><B>Build</B>
<DD>
To build the stars binary, either use the Imakefile or the 
sample makefile - Makefile.std. To build with the Imakefile, first type
"xmkmf" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system 
doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the stars binary will be built.
<P>
The manual pages can be formatted by typing "nroff -man stars.man > stars.doc" 

<DT><B>Install</B>
<DD>
To install stars, copy the stars binary to the desired location (the sample
makefiles put it in /usr/local/bin). Copy the resource file Stars.ad to
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Stars or append it to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file.
Copy the formatted man page to wherever you keep your local doc (i use
/usr/local/man/cat1 for imaging software), then add that location
to your MANPATH.
